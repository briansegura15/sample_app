## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Git, Github, Heroku

This project is built using the Ruby on Rails framework, which provides a robust and flexible platform for developing web applications. Here's an overview of the key components and technologies used in building this project:

Ruby on Rails: The project is developed using the Ruby programming language and the Rails framework, which follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to organize code and streamline development.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The front-end of the application is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic behavior.

Bootstrap: Bootstrap is utilized for responsive design and user interface components, providing a sleek and modern look to the application across various devices and screen sizes.

Database Management: The project leverages ActiveRecord, the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework in Rails, for database management and manipulation. PostgreSQL is used as the relational database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently.

User Authentication and Authorization: Devise, a flexible authentication solution for Rails, is integrated into the application to handle user authentication and session management. Additionally we implemented role-based authorization, allowing for granular control over user permissions and access levels.

Deployment: The application is deployed using a cloud-based platform such as Heroku to make it accessible to users over the internet.

By leveraging these technologies and frameworks, we've created a robust and scalable web application that provides a seamless user experience and meets the requirements of our project objectives.
